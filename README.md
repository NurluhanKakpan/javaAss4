HashTable
The HashTable is a data structure that allows you to store and retrieve key-value pairs efficiently. It provides constant-time performance for basic operations such as insertion, retrieval, and removal, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Usage
To use the HashTable class in your Java project, follow these steps:

Download the HashTable.java file from this repository.

Import the HashTable class into your Java file:
      
      import com.example.hashtable.HashTable;
      
      
Create an instance of the HashTable class:

    HashTable<String, Integer> hashtable = new HashTable<>();
Add key-value pairs to the HashTable using the put() method:

    hashtable.put("key1", 10);
    hashtable.put("key2", 20);
    hashtable.put("key3", 30);

Retrieve values from the HashTable using the get() method
    
    Integer value = hashtable.get("key2");

Check if a key exists in the HashTable using the containsKey() method:
    
    boolean exists = hashtable.containsKey("key3");

Implementation Details
The HashTable class is implemented using an array-based approach and uses a hash function to compute the index for each key-value pair. It handles collisions by using separate chaining with linked lists.

The HashTable class supports generic types for both keys and values, allowing you to store data of any type. It automatically handles resizing and rehashing to ensure optimal performance as the number of elements grows.

Time Complexity
The average time complexity of the HashTable operations is as follows:

      put(): O(1)
      get(): O(1)
      remove(): O(1)
      containsKey(): O(1)
      getKeys(): O(n)
      isEmpty(): O(1)
